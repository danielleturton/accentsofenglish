The compulsory reading (as found on the schedule) should be done before class.  There are lots more readings in addition to those found below mentioned in the lecture slides which you are encouraged to follow-up on.  Links are provided where possible, but using [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/) can help you locate readings which are not linked to here.  Books can be found in the [library](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/library/) 

<!-- The recommended follow-up reading below is non-compulsory and is to supplement your learning.  I recommend completing at least one follow-up reading per week.  Links are provided where possible, but using [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/) can help you locate readings which are not linked to here.  Books can be found in the [library](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/library/). -->
