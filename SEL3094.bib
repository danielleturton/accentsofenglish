@article{Docherty2005,
	Annote = {p. 179 we have adopted a methodology which we refer to as 'acoustic phonetic profiling.' This in- volves auditorily identifying glottal variants of/p t k/ and classifying and quantifying the acoustic features which are found at these sites. The ini- tial stage of the analysis was unconstrained in the sense that we simply recorded all of the properties that we observed

p.181 There is only sporadic guidance to be found in the literature regarding the acoustic characteristics that might be associated with tokens of stops being perceived as glottal or glottalised. Pierre- humbert (1995, p. 46) cites irregular periodicity as the prime acous- tic correlate of glottal allophones, noting that spectral correlates which might have been expected (such as narrow formant bandwidths, especially in the region of Fl, or an adjustment of spec- tral balance toward high frequencies 'in glottalized regions') were frequently not observed. She also mentions (p. 56) that in cases of glottal-reinforced [t], it is not always possible to tell if a coronal clo- sure occurred.

p.182 as already pointed out, in prepausal position, voiceless stops are only rarely glottalised, usually being clearly released instead},
