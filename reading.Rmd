```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Reading pack
  
The compulsory reading (as found on the schedule) should be done before class.  The recommended follow-up reading is non-compulsory and is to supplement your learning.  I recommend completing at least one follow-up reading per week.


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
